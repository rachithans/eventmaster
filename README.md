# EventMaster

Our project is a comprehensive online platform designed to connect event organizers, attendees, and service providers in a seamless and user-friendly manner. The platform aims to simplify the event planning process, foster social connections, and enhance the overall event experience for all stakeholders. The primary goal of our website is to develop an event management platform that helps event organizers efficiently create, manage, and promote their events. We would also aim to increase user engagement by providing a UI that would allow attendees to easily discover, register for, and share events of their interest. We aim to include features of social connections and post-event ratings that would help increase user interaction.
